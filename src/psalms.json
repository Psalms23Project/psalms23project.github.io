However, we shouldn't miss the vivid picture that it paints of Yahushua the Messiah.<br><br>This Psalm is actually a prophetic Psalm, quoted by Yahushua in John 15:25:<br><br><i>20 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you;  if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.<br>21 But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.<br>22 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.<br>23 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.<br>24 If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.<br>25 But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</i><br><br>If we look at the rest of the Psalm we see many other parallels.<br><br><i>\"False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not\"</i> and <i>\"They rewarded me evil for good\"</i> are just a few examples.<br><br>So let us \"shout for joy, and be glad\" and say \"Let Yahweh be magnified!\" for what He did for us.<br><br>1 Plead my cause, O Yahweh, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.<br>2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.<br>3 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.<br>4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.<br>5 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of Yahweh chase them.<br>6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of Yahweh persecute them.<br>7 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.<br>8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.<br>9 And my soul shall be joyful in Yahweh: it shall rejoice in His salvation.<br>10 All my bones shall say, Yahweh, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?<br>11 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.<br>12 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.<br>13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.<br>14 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.<br>15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:<br>16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.<br>17 Yahweh, how long wilt Thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.<br>18 I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise Thee among much people.<br>19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.<br>20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.<br>21 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.<br>22 This thou hast seen, O Yahweh: keep not silence: O Yahweh, be not far from me.<br>23 Stir up Thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my Elohim and my Sovereign.<br>24 Judge me, O Yahweh my Elohim, according to Thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.<br>25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.<br>26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.<br>27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let Yahweh be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of His servant.<br>28 And my tongue shall speak of Thy righteousness and of Thy praise all the day long."

But while their meat was yet in their mouths,<br>31 The wrath of Elohim came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.<br>32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for His wondrous works.<br>33 Therefore their days did He consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.<br>34 When He slew them, then they sought Him: and they returned and enquired early after Elohim.<br>35 And they remembered that El was their rock, and the high El their redeemer.<br>36 Nevertheless they did flatter Him with their mouth, and they lied unto Him with their tongues.<br>37 For their heart was not right with Him, neither were they stedfast in His covenant.<br>38 But He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned He his anger away, and did not stir up all His wrath.<br>39 For He remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<br>40 How oft did they provoke Him in the wilderness, and grieve Him in the desert!<br>41 Yea, they turned back and tempted Elohim, and limited the Holy One of Israel.<br>42 They remembered not His hand, nor the day when He delivered them from the enemy.<br>43 How He had wrought His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the field of Zoan.<br>44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.<br>45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.<br>46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.<br>47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.<br>48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br>49 He cast upon them the fierceness of His anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.<br>50 He made a way to His anger; He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<br>51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:<br>52 But made His own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br>53 And He led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br>54 And He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which His right hand had purchased.<br>55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br>56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high Elohim, and kept not His testimonies:<br>57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.<br>58 For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.<br>59 When Elohim heard this, He was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:<br>60 So that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He placed among men;<br>61 And delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the enemy's hand.<br>62 He gave His people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with His inheritance.<br>63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.<br>64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.<br>65 Then Yahweh awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.<br>66 And He smote His enemies in the hinder parts: He put them to a perpetual reproach.<br>67 Moreover He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:<br>68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved.<br>69 And He built His sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which He hath established for ever.<br>70 He chose David also His servant, and took Him from the sheepfolds:<br>71 From following the ewes great with young He brought him to feed Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.<br>72 So He fed them according to the integrity of His heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of His hands."

This Psalm reading was filmed in the countryside of Minnesota.<br><br>1 I love Yahweh, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.<br>2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.<br>3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.<br>4 Then called I upon the name of Yahweh; O Yahweh, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.<br>5 Gracious is Yahweh, and righteous; yea, our Elohim is merciful.<br>6 Yahweh preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.<br>7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for Yahweh hath dealt bountifully with thee.<br>8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.<br>9 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.<br>10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:<br>11 I said in my haste, All men are liars.<br>12 What shall I render unto Yahweh for all his benefits toward me?<br>13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of Yahweh.<br>14 I will pay my vows unto Yahweh now in the presence of all his people.<br>15 Precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his saints.<br>16 O Yahweh, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.<br>17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of Yahweh.<br>18 I will pay my vows unto Yahweh now in the presence of all his people,<br>19 in the courts of Yahweh’s house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem."

      "description": "Psalm 136 is a \"great praise\" psalm, filled with thanksgiving for Yahweh's mercy and what He has done. Each verse ends with the well-known refrain \"For His mercy endureth forever.\"<br><br>Although this psalm talks specifically about how Yahweh led Israel to victory against their enemies and gave them the land of inheritance, we should not feel that these lines of thanksgiving are far off from us today. Just as He \"overthrew Pharaoh\" for Israel and \"gave their land for an heritage\", Yahweh has delivered us from the enemy and given us a greater heritage to look forward to through His Son, Yahushua the Messiah.<br><br>It is so amazing to me how if you stop to ponder, you see that each Psalm ultimately does point back to the Messiah, either in a prophetic or symbolic sense (or both!).<br><br>We pray you are blessed and encouraged by this reading from Psalms 136.<br><br>1 O give thanks unto Yahweh; for He is good: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>2 O give thanks unto Elohim of mighty ones: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>3 O give thanks to the Sovereign of sovereigns: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>4 To Him who alone doeth great wonders: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>5 To Him that by wisdom made the heavens: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>6 To Him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>7 To Him that made great lights: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>8 The sun to rule by day: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>9 The moon and stars to rule by night: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>10 To Him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>11 And brought out Israel from among them: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>12 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>13 To Him which divided the Red sea into parts: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>14 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>15 But overthrew Pharaoh and His host in the Red sea: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>16 To Him which led His people through the wilderness: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>17 To Him which smote great kings: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>18 And slew famous kings: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>19 Sihon king of the Amorites: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>20 And Og the king of Bashan: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>21 And gave their land for an heritage: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>22 Even an heritage unto Israel His servant: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>23 Who remembered us in our low estate: for His mercy endureth for ever:<br>24 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>25 Who giveth food to all flesh: for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>26 O give thanks unto the Elohim of heaven: for His mercy endureth for ever."
