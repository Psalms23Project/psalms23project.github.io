      Who we are
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-2">
      The Psalms 23 Project is a ministry project by Richard and his sons Noah and Elijah Rahm, to create high-quality video and audio readings of the Psalms in nature. Richard reads the Psalms, Noah handles the filming, editing, and website, and Elijah monitors the audio and assists with setup. Together, we are The Psalms 23 Project team!

      What makes the Psalms 23 Project unique?
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-2">
      The Psalms 23 Project is unique in three ways:
    </p>
    <ol class="text-lg mt-2 list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>The readings are filmed in nature on location with no sound effects added later – everything you hear and see in the video was actually present at that location during filming the reading.</li>
      <li>We restore the name of our Heavenly Father, Yahweh, to where it appears in the original Hebrew Scriptures.  We want to "Give praise to Yahweh, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done." –Psalm 105:1
      </li>
      <li>We aim to align the location and weather during the filming with the overall mood or theme of the Psalm. Therefore, we film readings in different locations, seasons, and weather for the effect that each video is slightly different.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-lg mt-2">
      We provide the videos and audio for the Psalm readings on this website and on <a class="font-semibold underline hover:opacity-90 duration-300 ease-in-out" href="https://youtube.com/@ThePsalms23Project">our YouTube channel</a> freely for the edification and encouragement of others.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight mt-8">
      Future plans
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-2">
      We may, at some point, decided to create a CD/DVD collection of the Psalm readings. If we do, the CD/DVD set will also be available for free with a donation to recoup the cost of the materials. (“Freely ye have received, freely give.” –Matthew 10:8b)
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight mt-8">
      Ways You can help us

    <p class="text-lg mt-8">
      It is our prayer that Yahweh would use these videos to edify and encourage those who watch and listen to them. Praise Yahweh for the Psalms and His beautiful creation!
